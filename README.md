# image-comparison
A python script for a command-line program that when given URLs to two images can fetch and compare the images and rate them on a 0-100 scale.
The script requires following #prerequisites:
                    
                    #1. Python 2.7
Python libraries required are   #2. PIL, 
                    #3. numpy, 
                    #4. scipy, 
                    #5. urllib2, 
                    #6. io
  
  The script accepts, 2 URLs, one after another, and fetches these images and compare them, then rate on a 0-100 scale.
  
  This repo also hosts code for a Flask Web-App based on an earlier version of above mentioned script. Even tho web-app is working, it is not deployed any-where and is to be seen as unfinished. The above mentioned python script is how ever working.
